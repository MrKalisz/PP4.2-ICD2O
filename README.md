# Instructions  

# Practice Problem 4.2

1.

Ask the user for number of integers and store them in a list.

Find and output all its elements with even **indices** (i.e. A[0], A[2], A[4], ...) on the same line with a space between them.

# Example input

```
In: 5
```

```
In #1: 5 
In #2: 6 
In #3: 7 
In #4: 8 
In #5: 9
```

# Example output

```
5 7 9
```

# Example input

```
In: 3
```

```
In #1: 6 
In #2: 10
In #3: 5
```

# Example Output

```
6 5
```

2.

Ask the user for 6 integers and store them in a list.

Output all the elements with even values on the same line with a space between them. 

Use a for-loop that iterates over the list itself and not over its indices. 

That is, don't use range()

# Example input

```
In: 1
```

```
In: 2
```

```
In: 2
```

```
In: 3
```

```
In: 3
```

```
In: 4
```

# Example output

```
2 2 4
```

3.

Ask the user for 4 Strings and store them in a list.  

Output true if one of the strings is "hello", false otherwise.

**Note**: The _in_ keyword can also be used on lists.

# Example input

```
In: play
```

```
In: bye
```

```
In: hello
```

```
In: computer
```

# Example output

```
true
```
